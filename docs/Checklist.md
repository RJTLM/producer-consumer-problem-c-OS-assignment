To ensure your Sudoku Solution Validator project is completed to a high standard, hereâ€™s a detailed to-do list organized by priority. This checklist will guide you through finalizing your implementation, refining features, and preparing your submission.

### 1. Implement Validation Logic
- **Implement validation functions** in `sudoku_validator.c` for rows, columns, and subgrids. Ensure each function accurately checks for the presence of all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.
- **Integrate validation logic** into the `validate_section` function in `mssv.c`, using the mutex to manage shared resources safely.

### 2. Test and Debug Multithreading
- **Test the multithreading functionality** thoroughly to ensure that each thread correctly validates its assigned section of the Sudoku puzzle.
- **Debug any issues** related to race conditions or deadlocks. Utilize tools like `valgrind` or `gdb` if necessary to trace problems.

### 3. Implement Delay Functionality
- **Insert sleep** statements in each thread to simulate delays, ensuring that the delay parameter from the command line is correctly applied to each thread.

### 4. Setup Input/Output Handling
- **Improve file reading** in `utilities.c` to handle potential errors more gracefully, such as malformed input files.
- **Implement result output** in `mssv.c` to print whether each row, column, and subgrid is valid, along with the final validation status of the Sudoku puzzle.

### 5. Finalize Shared Data Structures
- **Ensure that shared data structures** (rows, columns, subgrids) in `mssv.h` are correctly updated and accessed by threads. Include necessary locks or other synchronization mechanisms.

### 6. Clean and Comment Code
- **Refactor and clean the code** across all files to remove unused variables, functions, and include necessary comments describing the functionality.
- **Ensure proper indentation and code style** guidelines are followed to enhance readability.

### 7. Prepare Documentation
- **Write a comprehensive README file** that includes instructions on how to compile and run the program, including the description of command-line arguments.
- **Document the design and synchronization strategy** in your code, specifying how threads interact and how race conditions are avoided.

### 8. Testing with Sample Inputs
- **Create a variety of test Sudoku puzzles**, both valid and invalid, to ensure your validator handles all scenarios correctly.
- **Document these test cases** and their expected outputs in your report.

### 9. Compile and Test the Makefile
- **Ensure the Makefile works correctly** and compiles the program without errors. Test the Makefile on different platforms if possible to ensure portability.

### 10. Submission Preparation
- **Organize all files** in the specified directory structure as required by the assignment.
- **Package your submission** as per the instructions, usually in a zip file containing all necessary source code, Makefile, documentation, and any additional resources.

### 11. Write the Assignment Report
- **Detail your implementation**, the challenges faced, and how they were overcome.
- **Explain the synchronization mechanism** in depth and discuss any parts of the program that might not work as expected or could be improved.

### 12. Peer Review and Feedback
- **Conduct a peer review** of your code if possible. Getting feedback from classmates or instructors can provide new insights and highlight issues you might have overlooked.

### 13. Final Run and Validate
- **Do a final run-through** of the entire program to ensure everything works as expected.
- **Validate all functionalities** one last time before submission.

This checklist ensures that every aspect of your project meets high standards and is ready for submission.
