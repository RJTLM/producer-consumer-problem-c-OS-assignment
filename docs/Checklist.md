### Review and Feedback on Codebase
1. **Header File Consistency:**
    - All header files should uniformly include guard clauses to prevent multiple inclusions. Make sure all headers are consistent in this respect.

2. **Error Handling:**
    - Error messages should be directed to `stderr` instead of `stdout`. This is a best practice for error logging and can be done using `fprintf(stderr, "Error message")`.

3. **Validation Logic:**
    - The placeholder comments in `thread_functions.c` need to be replaced with actual logic for validating rows, columns, and sub-grids.

4. **Thread Functionality:**
    - The logic for creating and managing threads appears to be started but needs full implementation, especially ensuring thread synchronization is correctly handled to prevent race conditions.

5. **Utility Functions:**
    - Functions like `printErrorMessage` and `printSudokuSolution` are crucial for debugging and output clarity. Ensure these are used effectively throughout your code for reporting statuses and errors.

6. **Memory Management:**
    - While your current implementation does not explicitly use dynamic memory allocation, always check for potential memory leaks or unnecessary memory usage.

7. **Documentation and Comments:**
    - Ensure that each function and major block of logic within functions is well-documented with comments explaining what the code does, which can be crucial for maintenance and evaluation purposes.

8. **Include Directories:**
    - Ensure that the compiler include paths are correctly set in the Makefile if your project structure uses nested directories for header files.

### Checklist for Completion
1. **Implement Validation Logic:**
    - Complete the implementation for `validateRows`, `validateColumns`, and `validateSubGrids` functions. Ensure they accurately check the Sudoku rules.

2. **Complete the Validation Output Implementation:**
   - You need to implement the section in `mssv.c` to collect results from threads and print a comprehensive report on the Sudoku's validity. This involves aggregating results from all threads and determining if the Sudoku is solved correctly.

3. **Test Thread Synchronization:**
    - Thoroughly test the thread synchronization especially where shared resources like `Row`, `Col`, `Sub`, and `Counter` are accessed. Use mutexes and condition variables correctly.

4. **Error Handling:**
    - Implement comprehensive error handling across all modules. Ensure that all potential failure points are gracefully managed.
    -  Your thread creation and joining are protected by error checks, which is excellent. Make sure to handle any potential errors that could arise during the thread's runtime, not just at creation and joining.

5. **Output Validation Results:**
    - Implement the functionality to print validation results as specified in your assignment requirements. This should include both correct and incorrect Sudoku configurations.

6. **Refactoring:**
    - Refactor any repetitive or complex parts of the code to improve readability and maintainability. Consider utility functions for common tasks.

7. **Comprehensive Testing:**
    - Test the application with various Sudoku puzzles and delay configurations to ensure robustness and correctness. Include both edge cases and typical cases.
    - Create a suite of test cases that your program can run through. This could be a separate function or script that tests various Sudoku configurations.

8. **Documentation:**
    - PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER needs the `Z` changed to an `S` (and anywhere where `initializer` exists.
    - Provide a detailed README file explaining how to compile and run the program, including any dependencies or external libraries.
    - Update your code with more detailed comments explaining how each part works, especially within the thread functions.
    - Document each function in the code, describing its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any side effects.

9. **Final Review:**
    - Perform a final review to check for consistency in coding style, naming conventions, and file structure.

10. **Prepare for Submission:**
     - Ensure that all files are named correctly and stored in the appropriate directory structure as required by the assignment. Zip the directory if required by the submission guidelines.
